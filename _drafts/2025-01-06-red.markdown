Cryptic crossword puzzles (the 'normal' kind if you're in the UK or a former Commonwealth country such as Canada)
are defined by the style of cluing, where each clue is made up of a word puzzle of some kind, and frequently
by a grid layout that limits the number of cross-words.

Automated tools, such as an anagram search, can be helpful in solving, or speeding the solution of cryptic
puzzles.
