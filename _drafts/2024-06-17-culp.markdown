There is no better telling of the tale of General Electric than William Cohan's 2022
epic [***Power Failure***](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609226/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan/){:ta rget="_blank"}. 

Key review points:

- Exhaustive treatment of early years, particularly the customer financing for providing power plants and local distribution.
- Long history of M&A on GE history
- Laborious disaquisitions on the personal lives of bit players, particularly those living.
- ** Need to spend more time looking at the Immelt succession story -- how did that happen?
- *** Beat out John McNerny, who went to 3M then Boeing, where
he led the 737Max, although his successor Muilenberg took the fall.
- *** not a detail guy. Impact of SUP (pension plan doled
out by CEO that paid huge post-retirement money if you stick around ' )\
- *** 2015 divestiture of 90% of GE Capital and expensive
complex Alstom acquisition, plus getting into bed with Trian.
- *** Immelt's signature failure was the long-term insurance debacle.
Or was it the Alstom debacle. Hard to say.

- ** Details of Alstrom acquisition
- ** Flannery succession
- *** Immelt resigned following the "pivot". Flannery was a GE lifer 
from capital. First person to really look at the businesses from
an operational point of view. Also correctly identified the three 
core businesses.
- Dismissive treatment of Culp -- was he using Flannery as a catspaw or did he simply execute the breakup plan originated by Flannery.
- ** Neither. Culp presumably saw Flannery's analysis, or maybe
it was so obvious a dog could see it. 
- ** Culp pushed out Flannery because he recognized

Thesis ideas:

- Conglomeration vs deconstruction. What is the relationship between how the individual components assembled to form GE and 
how did they spin apart to end it.
- GE management under Welch came to believe that the management themselves were the secret sauce. In fact, the unlocking of 
shareholder value by the breakup came with (perhaps because of) the destruction of centralized management. The individual companies 
are small enough that there is no place (spare cash flow) to build monuments to their management teams.
- To what degree has the emergence of more cost-effecctive software tools for basic back office functions along with SAAS products enable
- Look at total returns for GE stock purchased at the time of the big WSJ? article. About 400%.
- In the end, what GE leaders starting with Welch regarded as the 
core of GE's value (the management 'culture') was in fact what destroyed the company. People are all the same.
