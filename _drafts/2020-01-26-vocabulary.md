One of the things I enjoy about cryptics is the unfamiliar vocabulary. Some
recent gems:

* **Asafetida** (or asafoetida) *a foul-smelling resin extracted from ferula.*
* **Alchemic** *adjective form of Alchemy.*
* **Plastron** *the underside of a turtle's shell.*
* **Via Lactea** *Latin for 'the milky way'.*
* **Torero** *Bullfighter."*
* **Forename** *First name.*
* **Cicerone** *Guide who conducts tours of museums and historical sites.*
