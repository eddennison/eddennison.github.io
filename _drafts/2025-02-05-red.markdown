Cryptic crossword puzzles (the 'normal' kind if you're in the UK or a former Commonwealth country such as Canada)
are defined by the style of cluing, where each clue is made up of a word puzzle of some kind, and frequently
by a grid layout that limits the number of cross-words.

Cryptic crosswords also use a different style of clueing, nicely summarized by the [Emily Cox & Henry Rathvon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Cox_and_Henry_Rathvon) in the [Wall Street Journal](https://s.wsj.net/blogs/html/wsjcrypticguide.pdf):

>The clues each have two parts. One part is a normal definition of
the answer; the other is an additional hint using wordplay.
Having two hints in each clue might seem a big giveaway to
solvers. Why aren’t these clues twice as easy? The hitch: Either
hint may come first. The definition may appear before or after the
wordplay hint, often without any punctuation to mark the point
of division. The challenge and fun of a cryptic puzzle is to see
through the puzzle writer’s deceptions, to tease out the definition
by rethinking the clue’s wording.

For example, in this today's [Minute Cryptic](https://www.minutecryptic.com/) the clue was

> Spot for a massage...a little lower?

and the answer was **`CALF`**. (Lowing is the correct term for the noise that cows 
make, and by back-formation, a *lower* is someone or something that *lows* e.g. a cow, and a little cow would be...a calf, which also agrees with the definition making
up the first half of the clue, "[a] Spot for a massage".)

Some people might describe a cryptic crossword as a puzzle where every clue is its
own dad joke.

Automated tools, such as an anagram search, can be helpful in solving, or speeding the solution of cryptic
puzzles.
