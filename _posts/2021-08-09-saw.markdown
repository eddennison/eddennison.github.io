Sometimes the most effective method for communicating technical information is a quick drawing on a witeboard. 

A number of years ago, I acquired a Craftsman tablesaw from the 1930s:

Although it was somewhat the worse for wear:

I installed a modern rip fence, table extensions, and an outflow table:

I've been meaning to write up some of te clever ways that I needed to adapt a modern 
fence to this ancient saw, but Ive been stymied by the problem of how to illustrate the story. 

I wanted to avoid the time-consuming work of creating a parametric representation of my work (Sketchup or OnShape), and I 
was interested in a more informal look, so I tried creating sketches on my ReMarkable 2 tablet.

The saw, in all its glory

Trying to hang the fence rail doesn't work -- the table isn't thick enough!

So let's mount a 1x1 steel tube to the bottom of the table -- fortunately, the table has 3/8 threaded holes in the underside.

Now we're cooking.

Because the  rail now has a tall enough surface to bolt up against.
