Once you own a domain, especially domain named after yourself, you're kind of stuck with it. You can't really just throw it back into the ocean. For a long time,
this domain was pointed at a page created with the "original" Google Sites (you can see it [here](https://sites.google.com/site/eddennisonbeta/)), but there was no easy way to support https with a custom domain on legacy Google Sites. 

I was naturally pleased to discover how easy it was to get a Github-hosted Markdown site to work with https.
