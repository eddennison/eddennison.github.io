Leading North American cryptic crossword setters Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon (collectively known 
as [Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Cox_and_Henry_Rathvon)) recently 
retired, just about the time that I became more interested in cryptics. Cryptics
are popular in Britain, so many of the more challenging puzzles on line are 
made more challenging by the presence of British references.

I have been working my way through some of Hex's older puzzles published in
Canada's [National Post](https://nationalpost.com/). The puzzles are not available through the Post website, but can be found 
[here](https://natpostcryptic.blogspot.com/).

A New York Times cryptic from a year ago 
tripped me up with the clue *Obscure quote spreading around on Democrat*. 
I already had the following letters from cross-words:
 
    R _ C _ _ _ _ _E

I assumed the word to be `RECHERCHE` and I assumed the clue was some how related 
to HRC -- Hilary Rodham Clinton. Turns out that the answer was `RECONDITE`, 
providing a lovely pair of nine-letter synonms sharing their first, third, and
final letters.

The official explanation from [The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/crosswords/variety-cryptic-crossword.html) offers:

> This solution is also an unusual word, with a 
> difficult container clue. “Obscure quote spreading 
> around on Democrat” solves to RECONDITE, which 
> means “dealing with abstruse or difficult subjects.” 
> To solve, wrap a word for “quote” — RECITE — around 
> OND, or “on Democrat.”

My first thought had been that the Democrat was [Gary **CONDIT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Condit).
