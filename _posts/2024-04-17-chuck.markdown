"Nerds of a certain age" are likely to have heard of, or perhaps even watched, the TV show [**Chuck**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)). In addition to some amusing writing and strong performances by Adam Baldwin and Zachary Levi, the series featured a recurring leitmotif of notable books on software design and development.

The episode [***Chuck and the Broken Heart***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Versus_the_Broken_Heart) features the definitive work on XSLT: [***XSLT Programmer's Reference***](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/XSLT+2+0+Programmer's+Reference,+3rd+Edition-p-9780764576492).

This book was my contstant companion for many years as I developed tooling to work with XML-based documentation content.

I always appreciated the clarity and completeness of the book, as well as Michael Kay's [continuing support of the language](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75607587/using-additional-xml-tree-within-xslt-stylesheet-but-document-function-is-n).
