Despite numerous comments from the [chattering classes](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/11th-hour/are-americans-unhappy-strong-economy-rcna139546) about how Americans are "just misinformed" about the impact of Bidenomics on their daily lives, [Labor Departments inflation statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2024/consumer-price-index-2023-in-review.htm) when it comes to food don't lie:

Over the same time period (2019-2024) our [awesome local bagel bakery](https://www.bluemoonbagel.com/) increased their price for a baker's dozen bagels by **37%**, from $13.95 to $19.05. So I started baking bagels myself. After several weeks of experimentation, I settled on a recipe that produces bagels that are the equal of those from the shop. 

And what do they cost?

|Ingredient|Cost (/gm)|Amount|Cost|Notes
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------------------|
|Diastatic Barley Malt Powder|$0.02|30g|$0.60|Best price for 1.5 pounds from Amazon|
|Yeast|$0.05|10g|$0.50|Fleischman's Active Dry 4oz bottle, retail from Target|
|Flour|$.0026|1100g|$1.05|King Arthur Special Patent (50 pound bag from Restaurant Depot)|
|Baking Soda|$.044|10g|$0.04|To adjust pH of pre-bake boiling bath|
|Salt|$0.022|10g|$0.02|Morton salt, retail|
|Toppings|varies|varies|$0.50|Retail poppy seeds, sesame seeds, jar garlic|
|Electricity|$0.30/kWh|2 kWh|$0.60|Electric stove, Eversource residential rate|

Total cost **$3.31** per dozen (recipe makes 12 bagels), so $0.28 per bagel versus $1.47 from the bagel shop.
